              I'm a designer, engineer, and lecturer at the University of Miami.

          <p>
            I teach classes in data visualization, data storytelling, and web
            development at the University of Miami. Before that, I was on the
            teaching team for MIT Mechanical Engineering's product design
            capstone course. And before <em>that</em>, I spent most of 2018
            investigating hate crimes as a Carnegie-Knight News21 fellow.

          <p>
            When I'm not working, I like to read manga and watch Bollywood
            movies. I miss visiting design museums and bookshops.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from <strong>MIT</strong>, and
            an MS in Visual Communications from
            <strong>Syracuse University</strong>.

          <p>
            For the last few years I've worked alone and with others to design
            products, investigate hate crimes, and tell stories. A lot of things
            have stopped working or weren't documented as thorougly, but here
            are a few projects I enjoyed:
